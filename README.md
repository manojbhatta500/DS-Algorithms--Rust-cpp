##DSA - My Learning Journey

This repository tracks my progress in learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It includes solutions to problems, algorithm implementations, and practice sessions. Files are implemented in either C++ or Rust, depending on the task and experimentation.

##Folder Structure

solutions/: Problem-solving solutions from platform (LeetCode), written in either C++ or Rust.

learn/: Practice files exploring DSA concepts such as arrays, recursion, and linked lists, implemented in either language.

algorithms/: Implementations of standard algorithms like sorting, searching, and graph traversal in either C++ or Rust.


#How to Run

For C++ Files
To compile and run a C++ file:

g++ -o output_file solutions/solution_1.cpp
./output_file


For Rust Files
To run a Rust file:
rustc solutions/solution_1.rs
./solution_1
