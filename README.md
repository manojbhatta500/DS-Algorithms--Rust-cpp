# DSA in C++ - My Learning Journey

This repository tracks my progress in learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using C++. It contains solutions to problems, algorithm implementations, and personal practice sessions.

## Folder Structure

- **solutions/**: Problem-solving solutions from platforms (LeetCode, HackerRank, etc.).
- **learn/**: Practice files where I experiment with DSA concepts.
- **algorithms/**: Core algorithm implementations such as sorting, searching, and graph traversal.

## How I Use This Repository:
- **solutions/**: Each file (e.g., `solution_1.cpp`) contains a solution to a DSA problem, along with comments explaining the problem and approach.
- **learn/**: Practice exercises that explore different data structures or algorithmic techniques (arrays, recursion, linked lists, etc.).
- **algorithms/**: Implementations of standard algorithms (e.g., QuickSort, DFS).

## How to Run:
To compile and run any file, use the following commands in the terminal:
```bash
g++ -o output_file solutions/solution_1.cpp
./output_file
# DS-Algorithms-cpp
